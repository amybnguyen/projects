## General info
This is a web application that allows users to create and manage their own profile. They can then add photos to their portfolio - only one photo can be associated with each day. It acts like a Project 365 portfolio. Users' portfolio data are stored in a SQL database and is reloaded when they log in. Photos can also be deleted from the portfolio if the user wishes.
